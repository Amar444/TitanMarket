# TitanMarket
Small side project. 
A friend needed a simple application to monitor his in-game auctions to see if he was making profit and how much in-game money he earned over a certain period.

This project was made in somewhere in 2013 and was one of my first small Java projects ever.
Java was still very new to me, so I offered to make him this project so I could also learn more (learning project!).
